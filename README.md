## Goal:

To collaborate on a pokemon gym website showcasing all chosen pokemon from the prior trainer project by utilizing libraries written by individual group members. This project is focused on client side technologies.

## Learning Objectives:

Upon successful completion of this project, the student will demonstrate their understanding of teamwork and software engineering collaboration via Github.

 

## Instructions:

As a result of your poke showcase, you have decided to group up with at least one other person to combine your poke powers and create a gym. To promote your gym, you have decided, along with your partner, to showcase both sets of pokemon on a website. However, because each member owns different pokemon and have different methods of displaying data you will have to use each member’s objects they have built in the creation of their training website as the library.

The good news is that you already have a container object that retrieves pokemon and an object representing a pokemon as an object. Work together to utilize both container objects to gather data on each set of pokemon and display their relevant information on the specific individual pokemon pages. Work together to understand each other’s code before coding, this is essential to working successfully in a software engineering team.

### Some questions to ask yourself:

* How do I combine design aesthetics ?
* How can I utilize the other group members’ object code in this project?
* What should I name my gym?
Good luck! :)

 

## Completion Requirements:

A completed project should:

* have a gym name
* have code from prior trainer assignment within a library js file
* utilize library code from all group members
* be hosted on github pages
* list information on all pokemon from all members
* have at least three meaningful commits per group member
 

Note: A meaningful commit is a commit that adds a significant feature to the project.
